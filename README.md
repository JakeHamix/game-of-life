# game-of-life
Simple "Game of Life" console application with console output (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life).

Created mainly for "EmbedIT" project (https://zazij.embedit.cz/).
With that in mind, this Game of Life supports only square-sized dimensions!

Following the basic principles of the Game of Life, this application provides you with a way to enter the initial data 
through a configuration file and then just sit back and enjoy the show!

This application is written in Node, but unless you want to run the tests, you don't need to download any packages :)

If you'd like to, then:

"npm i" => "npm run-script test"
